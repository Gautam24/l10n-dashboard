l10n-dashboard
==============

A dashboard for keeping track of l10n statistics for various projects in a single page being developed with ease of access for localizers in mind. As an added feature the Dashboard would be developed in a mobile friendly responsive layout.


Development Status
==================

The project is currently in  Development Phase 1, with only a basic list of localiztion project links.


Development Plan
================

The Dashboard would be developed in phases as follows:-

Phase 1:
--------
Create a simple HTML page listing out various l10n initiatives across various Open Source projects, and providing links to their individual l10n dashboards.

Phase 2:
--------
Incorporate language selection buttons [Dropdown menu with a list of most common languages], which would allow localizers to select the language of their choice. Upon selection of a prefered locale, the individual project links would be replaced by links to locale specific dashboard for the projects. For non-existing locales links to remain unchanged.

Phase 3:
--------
Incorporate Dashboard APIs from the most common l10n dashboards such as Transifex and Pootle, to provide translation statistics on the L10n Dashboard itself, hence allowing the localizers to have a good idea of the progress in translations in a single glance.

Phase 4:
--------
Incorporate Visual improvements to provide interactive menus as well as colorful progress bars. Incorporate an app-manifest to allow the usage of the site as a Web-App.
